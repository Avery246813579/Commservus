# Commservus
A website to connect community service organizations with the people who want to help

## What is Commservus
Commservus (come-serve-us) is a project that aims to connect community
service organizations with volunteers who want to help. 

## What is this project?
This is the server for the Commservus project!

## Installation
1. Download and clone repo
2. Open project in terminal and use `npm start`

## Workflow
The workflow is quite easy. We have a slack and trello in which we 
coordinate features we want to add. Email me at avery@frostbyte.co
to get added to them.  

Once you join, take a look at our trello and find a card with a 
feature or bug you want to do. Then add yourself as a member. You
will have two weeks to finish that card or you will be removed from
the card.

Once you finished a feature or bug, submit a PR and we will have
a code review for you, then accept your code. 

## Keep In Mind
We are a test oriented project. If you add a new route to the server
we expect some tests to be along with it.
